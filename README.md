# Travel-path-optimizer

This project is a practical implementation of Djikstra algorithm with a visual representation of graphs. Random graphs are generated on each new problem and solved by Djikstra's Algorithm. Optimized route is selected by choosing between flights and buses in the graph. To construct graphs, vis.js library was used.
